# US-Flight-Delay-Prediction-Using-Big-Data-and-PySpark

A comprehensive project predicting flight delays in the US using big data techniques with PySpark. Includes data integration, exploratory analysis, geographical visualization, and machine learning models for classification, clustering, and regression.

## Project Structure

- **Data Integration**: Combines multiple data sources and performs initial cleaning.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigates patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset.  
- **Geographical Visualization**: Maps flight routes and delays to provide spatial insights.  
- **Classification**: Implements algorithms to predict whether a flight will be delayed.  
- **Clustering**: Groups flights to identify common characteristics of delayed flights.  
- **Regression**: Predicts the duration of flight delays in minutes.  

## Data Source

- **Dataset**: [Airline Delay and Cancellation Data (2009–2018)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018)  
- **Focus**: Only data from **2018** is used for analysis.  

## Technologies Used

- **PySpark** – Large-scale distributed data processing  
- **Python** – Scripting and machine learning implementation  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – Interactive development and analysis
