# US-Flight-Delay-Prediction-Using-Big-Data-and-PySpark

Project Structure

The repository is organized into multiple Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on a specific component of the analysis:

Data Integration: Merges data from various sources and performs initial cleaning to prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explores the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.

Geographical Visualization: Visualizes flight routes and delays on maps to provide spatial insights.

Classification: Implements classification algorithms to predict whether a flight will be delayed.

Clustering: Groups flights based on similarities to reveal common characteristics of delayed flights.

Regression: Develops regression models to predict the duration of flight delays in minutes.



Data Source

The analysis uses the Airline Delay and Cancellation Data from 2009 to 2018
, which contains detailed records of flight delays and cancellations in the United States. For this project, only data from 2018 is considered.

Technologies Used

PySpark: For large-scale distributed data processing.

Python: For scripting and implementing machine learning models.

Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive coding, analysis, and documentation.
